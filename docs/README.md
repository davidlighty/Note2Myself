Notes API
=========

PHP assignment for BCIT 2920 for presentation


###Idea

Create a "twitter" -esque steaming notes system.  This is an API system, which any front end could then use to get and find notes.  People will use this system to create personal notes or ideas that need to be shared with the collective counsiousness.


###Goals

#### PHP Backend
- Slim framework for rapid API development
- phpDocumentor for API documentation
- phpUnit for Unit Testing
- TravisCI (with Github) for Continous Integration testing

#### Data Layer
- MongoDB

#### Web Frontend
- Use Yeoman/Bower/Grunt for the web front end
- Backbone js for front end MVC setup

#### User Auth
- Allow an integrated User auth through Twitter
- Allow a local user auth scenario
