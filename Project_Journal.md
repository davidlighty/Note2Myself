===============

Write little snippets of what was done with this project, dreams and research, issues and resolutions.

Author: 	David Lighty
Project: 	Note2Myself clone
For:		Jason Harrison | BCIT | COMP2920 PHP

### Goal

The main site to clone http://note-to-myself.com is a simple note keeper, with the ability to keep text notes, website, and todos.  The goal is to re-create this, using whatever PHP we would prefer.  This is our final project for the class.

#### Personal Vision

I took this and wanted to make something more, bigger, grander....like I do with everything.  It's a canvas to expand upon and Jason is very welcoming of that.  Below here will be small snippets of things in an attempt to highlight what was done.
